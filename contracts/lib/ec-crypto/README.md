# Elliptic Curve Cryptography library

Taken from [a16z's powers of tau library](https://github.com/a16z/evm-powers-of-tau/tree/master/contracts/library), which is itself based on [Keep network's v1 crypto libraries](https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/tree/main/solidity-v1/contracts/cryptography) for EC precompiles.
